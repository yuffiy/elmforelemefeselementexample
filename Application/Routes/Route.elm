If you are willing to write some boilerplate, `reverse` can be used to
construct a type safe reverse routing function specific to your
application:

    toString : Sitemap -> String
    toString r =
      case r of
        HomeR  -> reverse homeR []
        UsersR  -> reverse usersR []
        UserR uid -> reverse userR [toString uid]

    > toString HomeR
    "/"

    > toString UsersR
    "/users"

    > toString (UserR 1)
    "/users/1"

`reverse` will crash at runtime if there is a mismatch between the
route and the list of arguments that is passed in. For example:

    > reverse deepR []
    Error: Ran into a `Debug.crash` in module `Route`

    This was caused by the `case` expression between lines 145 and 175.
    One of the branches ended with a crash and the following value got through:

        ([],[CInt,CInt,CInt])

    The message provided by the code author is:

        'reverse' called with an unexpected number of arguments

    > reverse deepR ["a"]
    Error: Ran into a `Debug.crash` in module `Route`

    This was caused by the `case` expression between lines 171 and 176.
    One of the branches ended with a crash and the following value got through:

        Err ("could not convert string 'a' to an Int")

    The message provided by the code author is:

        could not convert string 'a' to an Int in a call to 'reverse'
